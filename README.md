**Bulk Edit Verifier tool for Bigcommerce and Shopify**
To ensure a smooth migration between BigCommerce and Shopify, I have developed a Bulk Edit Verifier tool. This tool automates the verification process, checking for any missing products after the migration.

The Bulk Edit Verifier is designed to efficiently handle large datasets, comparing the product catalogs of both platforms to identify any discrepancies. It provides a detailed report highlighting any missing products, enabling you to quickly rectify any issues that may arise during the migration process.

This tool simplifies the verification process, saving you valuable time and ensuring that your product data is accurately transferred between BigCommerce and Shopify or vice versa.
I have developed this tool to save time in my workplace.
